# Project ERD Diagram

This is the currnet ERD Diagram of the project. As you may notice that it's quite simple and not too sophiscated. This is because of the key features defined of the project. There is a potential to further expand on these requirements later on, however currently laying it out early on provides a good scope and planning for inital development.
